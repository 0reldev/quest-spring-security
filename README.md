# Quest "Spring Security"

## Educational exercise from Wild Code School

This quest introduces the Spring Security Maven dependency. 

This simple site have three routes in a controller. 

First, two profiles have to be created with two different roles: Steve, as a `CHAMPION`, and Nick, as a `DIRECTOR`. 

The web site has a controller with three routes. 

The objective is to make the index route `/` accessible for everyone, the `/avengers/assemble` route accessible for both Steve and Nick (`CHAMPION` and `DIRECTOR` profiles)
and the `/secret-bases` accessible by Nick only (`DIRECTOR`). The last route will return a JSON with informations about the secret base.
